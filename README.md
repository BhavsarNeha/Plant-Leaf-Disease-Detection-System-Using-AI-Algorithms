## 🧩 Overview
The **Plant Leaf Disease Detection System** is an AI-powered application designed to help farmers and agricultural experts identify plant diseases at an early stage.  
Using **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** algorithms, the system analyzes leaf images and classifies them as **healthy** or **diseased**, enabling timely and effective treatment.

This project includes:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training using CNN/MLP-based architectures
- Web deployment using Flask
- A simple and interactive web interface for real-time predictions

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** or **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** designed to detect plant leaf diseases efficiently.
It consists of:

* **Input Layer:** Image pixels or extracted features
* **Hidden Layers:** Using **ReLU** activation for non-linearity
* **Output Layer:** **Sigmoid** or **Softmax** for classification

> Activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid help the model learn complex patterns in leaf images.

### 📁 To make it perfect visually:
- Create a folder: `/assets/`
- Add images:
  - `healthy_leaf_sample.jpg`
  - `diseased_leaf_sample.jpg`
  - `upload_page.jpg`
  - `prediction_page.jpg`
- Update the links in the table with your actual GitHub image URLs (they’ll render automatically).

Would you like me to include a **“Model Training Details”** section (with optimizer, epochs, and loss function) too — for a more research-oriented README?
